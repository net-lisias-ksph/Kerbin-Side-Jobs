# Kerbin-Side Jobs :: Change Log

* 2016-0428: 2.0 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ Included v0.1 of KerKonConConExt.dll.
	+ This extends Contract Configurator to allow contracts to more directly operate on Kerbal Konstructs.
	+ Included an example contract that makes use of these extensions - TestFlight110011.cfg.
	+ Documentation for using the extensions will be added to the Kerbal Konstructs thread shortly.
	+ Many .cfgs renamed but internal names have not, so hopefully CC won't have fits.
	+ However, please back up your saves before installing.
	+ And you should completely delete the KerbinSideJobs from GameData/ContractPacks before installing. Don't just put this version on top.
* 2016-0409: 1.6 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ No changelog provided
